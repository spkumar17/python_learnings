# Addition with float
num1 = 2.5
num2 = 4.5
sum_num = num1 + num2
print(sum_num)  # Outputs 7.0 (float)

# Subtraction with float
received = 3.0
spent = 2.2
remaining = received - spent
print(remaining)  # Outputs 0.7999999999999998 (due to floating-point precision)


# Multiplication with float
print(3.5 * 2)  # Outputs 7.0

# Division with float
print(7.0 / 2)  # Outputs 3.5 (float division)


# Integer division with float
print(7.0 // 2)  # Outputs 3.0 (quotient, without fractional part)


# Modulo with float
print(7.5 % 2)  # Outputs 1.5 (7.5 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1.5)


# Exponentiation with float
print(2.5 ** 2)  # Outputs 6.25

# Converting string to float
x = float("42.3")  # Converts string "42.3" to float
print(x)  # Outputs 42.3
print(type(x))  # Outputs <class 'float'>

# Converting integer to float
y = float(5)  # Converts integer 5 to float
print(y)  # Outputs 5.0
