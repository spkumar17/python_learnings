# division
print(3 / 2)  # This will output 1.5 because it performs regular division.

print(3 // 2) # // (floor division) returns the floor value to the result of normal division.

# modulo division
print(3 % 2) # (gives reminder) # This will output 1 because 3 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1.

print(3**3)

#Type Conversion with int() Function:

x = int("42")   #----> this  converts string value "42" to an int data type
print(type(x))

y = int(4.7)  # this converts float to int 
print(type(y))
