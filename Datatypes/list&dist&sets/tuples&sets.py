# tuples are same as list but they are immutable.
# we can't change the values inside the tuplee.

print(my_tuple.count(1))  # this says how many times 1 appiare in the tuple
print(my_tuple.index(2)) # this will display the index value of an element 


#set have only unique set of values

print(my_set)  #output will be {1, 2, 34, 4, 54, 22, 63}
